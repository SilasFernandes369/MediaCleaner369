We are launching public preview for a simple and intuitive Python library (google.colab.ai) to access state-of-the-art language models directly within Colab environments. All users have free access to most popular LLMs, while paid users have access to a wider selection of models. This means users can spend less time on configuration and set up and more time bringing their ideas to life. With just a few lines of code, you can now perform a variety of tasks:\n",

            "Elara lived in the quiet town of Oakhaven, a place where cobblestone streets hummed with daily life and the scent of baking bread always seemed to hang in the air. But Elara had a secret, an unusual gift that felt more like a curse: she was a melody thief.\n",
            "\n",
            "It wasn't a malicious act, not really. It was an instinct, a hunger deep within her soul. When someone hummed a joyful tune, whistled a jaunty jig, or even just had a catchy jingle stuck in their head, Elara could, with a mere touch or even just focused attention, draw the melody from them. It would shimmer for a moment, an invisible thread, before settling into her, becoming part of her vast, internal collection.\n",
            "\n",
            "The person, however, would be left with a blank spot. A sudden inability to recall the tune, a vague feeling of something lost, a word on the tip of their tongue that simply wouldn't come. Elara saw the momentary confusion, the slight frowns, and it always pricked her conscience, a tiny needle in her heart. But the urge, the craving for new harmonies, was too strong to resist. Her own life was silent, devoid of the ability to create music herself, and she yearned for its beauty.\n",
            "\n",
            "One crisp autumn afternoon, Elara watched a young boy, no older than five, skipping down the lane. He was humming a bright, innocent tune, a simple song about butterflies and sunshine. Beside him, his elderly grandmother walked, her hand resting gently on his shoulder, her face alight with pride as she softly joined in. It was a perfect harmony, a shared moment of pure, unadulterated joy.\n",
            "\n",
            "Elara felt the familiar pull, stronger than ever. The melody was so pure, so full of love. She reached out, an almost involuntary gesture, and felt the vibrant thread detach. It pulsed once in her grasp, then settled.\n",
            "\n",
            "The grandmother stopped humming abruptly. Her eyes, which had just moments ago sparkled with warmth, now held a bewildered sadness. \"My dear, what was that tune you were singing?\" she asked, her voice faltering. \"I... I can't quite remember it.\"\n",
            "\n",
            "The boy, Finn, looked up, confused. \"But Grandma, you always sing it with me! It's our butterfly song!\" He tried to hum it again, but his small voice was tentative, the melody broken, hesitant. He couldn't quite recall the words or the notes.\n",
            "\n",
            "Elara watched as the light faded from their faces, replaced by a quiet disappointment. It wasn't just a song she had stolen; it was a memory, a shared joy, a piece of their connection. The stolen melody within her felt heavy, leaden, no longer a treasure but a burden.\n",
            "\n",
            "That night, Elara didn't sort through her collection. She didn't savor the stolen notes. Instead, she sat by her window, listening to the silence, the echo of Finn's questioning voice haunting her. She knew then that she couldn't keep doing this. The ache in her soul couldn't be filled by another's loss.\n",
            "\n",
            "The next morning, Elara did something unprecedented. She went to the town square, carrying an old, forgotten lute she had found in her attic years ago. Her fingers, usually so adept at stealing, were clumsy as she plucked the strings. Discordant notes scraped and jangled, attracting curious stares.\n",
            "\n",
            "But she persisted. She thought of the butterfly song, of the joy she had taken, and tried to weave something new. She didn't try to *give back* the exact melody; she couldn't. But she could create. Slowly, haltingly, a new tune emerged, not the butterfly song, but a song *of* butterflies, light and airy, full of gentle hope.\n",
            "\n",
            "People paused. They listened. Finn and his grandmother, passing by, stopped. The old woman's eyes widened slightly, a faint, sweet smile touching her lips. Finn, catching the familiar *feeling* of a butterfly, began to hum along, a new melody taking root in his heart.\n",
            "\n",
            "Elara played on, day after day. She learned to compose, not just to collect. She created tunes of sun-drenched fields, of whispering winds, of laughter and shared moments. She became the town's bard, her melodies filling Oakhaven with a vibrant, original music that soothed souls and sparked joy.\n",
            "\n",
            "Sometimes, she still felt the faint echo of a stolen tune within her, a ghost of past transgressions. But now, when she played, the notes she produced were her own, born of a quiet remorse and a profound, newfound desire to give, to create, and to fill the world with beauty, rather than take it away. Elara, the melody thief, had finally found her true song."
